README!!!
- Instructions that you have to implement: sw, lw, beq, j, add, andi, slt, slti

- Top Level Design File: mips_core

- Testbench File: mips_testbench

- mips_registers.v is register module
- registers.mem for initialization of registers

- mips_instr_mem.v is instruction memory module
- instruction.mem for instruction memory initialization

- mips_data_mem.v is data memory module
- data.mem for data memory initialization

* You can add/change any inputs and outputs to template modules. All of them just startpoint for you. 
* You should add comments as defined in project.
* You have to create report include intoduction, methods, results part.
* End of the test stage, you have to save register & data contents to res_registers.mem , res_data.mem (create new files)
